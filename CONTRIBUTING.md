# Contributing to Codotto Image Generator
Thank you very much for showing interest in contributing to this open source project.

All kinds of contribution is valued here.

## Submitting an issue
In case you have found an issue with the project (or a bug), feel free to submit it. We highly
advise to search first in our [issues](https://github.com/Codotto/codotto-image-generator/issues) tab. Maybe an issue already exists and there is an answer to it.

While we want to fix all the issues, before fixing a bug we need to be able to reproduce and confirm it. Please provide us with a [minimal reproduction scenario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_reproducible_example) using a repository or [Gist](https://gist.github.com/). Having a live, reproducible scenario gives us the information without asking questions back & forth with additional questions.

Without said minimal reproduction, we won't be able to investigate all issues, and the issue might not be resolved.

You can open a new issue with this [issue form](https://github.com/Codotto/codotto-image-generator/issues/new/choose).
